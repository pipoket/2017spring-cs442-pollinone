# Poll-in-one

## What does this do

Create and join poll in one action.

## Motivation

People waste a lot of their precious time to gather opinion for simple group activities.
Think about you and your friends wasting time at fraternities, sororities or school club
to count *the number of raised hands* again and again to decide where to eat out.

## How does it work

With Poll-in-one, you can create a room for vote. The room information is broadcasted
via bluetooth and sound<sup>1</sup>. Other friends can join your room by simply launching
the application. Their Poll-in-one will catch the broadcasted signal and automatically let
your friends join the room. Joining a vote can never be easier than using Poll-in-one.

<sup>[1] Tentative. This feature may not be available at the time of release.</sup>
